# CGT215-MWK-Final_Project

#4/16/2024 -- Currently still working on the ball physics, sometimes stops existing when hits a wall a weird way or a corner.
Currently have the physics between the ball and the pong-paddle working however.

Will add another paddle, scoring, and menu options once the core game mechanics have been fully fixed.

#5/3/2024 -- Unfortunately could not augment the menu that I wanted, however full game including scoring system had been implemented.
